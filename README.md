# The shape
Mountain is form by two different kind of irregular polygon.
It is created as the background of  the picuture where the mountains are the background.
The ground is the grass on the picture, which is form by the rectangle.
The cloud of randomness is deternmined by the random number pass in as the parameter.
It is form by different circles.

# Randomness and User Input
Everytime the user hits reroll, the mountain to change to a different shape.
Also, the cloud will spawn by a random chance. 
The sunlight is controled by the user mouse position. As the user move the mouse, the tree will moves along with the mouse.

# Artist Statement
My goal for this project is to simulate the shapes of the image into 2D.
I want to show the audience the inspring nature to them. As a result, I added in a big mountain as the background. This will gives people a strong contract of the image layer. I added in the cloud show the height of the mountain. 
I think I achieve that effect, but I think there is still improvement. I think I can have more detail of the image add in to my project.
